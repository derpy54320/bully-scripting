			<h1>Welcome to the new Bully LUA Reference!</h1>
			<p>
				A brand new site built from the ground up with the simple goal of being the best bully script modding resource!
				Along with documenting everything there is to know about scripting the base game, this site also serves to document <a href="/downloads.html#dsl">derpy's script loader (DSL)</a>.
				If you are interested in script modding and are not familiar with it, I strongly suggest you check it out! It aims to take away all the annoying parts of scripting this game.
			</p>

				Search for anything using the navigation bar on the left, or click the big navigation button if you're on mobile.

				Make sure JavaScript is enabled if you cannot see the navigation bar.

			<h1>Other resources.</h1>
			<h2>Notepad++</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">Notepad++</a> is the text editor of choice for most of us Bully scripters.
				There are many other (more complex) editors, but this is a great way to keep it simple.
			</p>
			<h2>Lua 5.0.2</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.0/">Lua 5.0.2</a> is the version of Lua that Bully uses.
				Be sure to check out the official manual if you need to brush up on the language itself.<br/>
				Keep in mind that Bully does not load the entire standard library, so a lot of it may be irrelevant unless you are using <a href="/downloads.html#dsl">DSL</a>.
			</p>
			<h2>Server Manual</h2>
			<p>
				Check out the <a href="/server.html">server manual</a> if you are interested in setting up your own server.
